Simple Rails app for interfacing with Firebase.io infrustructure.
Developed for the 2015 Makerbot Thingeverse Hack-a-thon.

The app will post a film recommendation from themoviedb.org based on time of day
and frequency of refrigerator raids.  The interface is with two Arduino devices and
and LED screen readout which will display the movie title and synopsis.
